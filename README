To mimic what gu and gU do for ascii,
I defined two new maps, gS and gT, to transfer between
the simplified Chinese and the traditional Chinese.

Features:

(a) "quick and dirty" way to transfer Chinese to Chinese
(b) 20% of efforts for solving 80% of problems
(c) 2172 Chinese pairs are used for one-to-one map
(d) cursor position is kept after gS or gT
(e) [range] for visual mode is supported
